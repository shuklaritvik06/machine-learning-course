## How we choose the dummy variables?

Alwayse no matter how many of the categorical columns we have we have to omit one of the categorical dummy variables from the total we have, suppose we have 10 then only 9 we have to consider. SO suppose we are having a column of Gender with Male and Female then we will only have the dummy variable for one in the linear equations

```
y = b0+b1x1+b2x2+b3D3

D3= Dummy Variable
```
