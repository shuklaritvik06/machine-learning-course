Feature scaling is the process of normalizing the range of features in a dataset. Real-world datasets often contain features that are varying in degrees of magnitude, range, and units.
Feature Scaling is done in the column not on a row, feature scaling are of two types normalization and standardization. We can see the normalization is subtracting min of column from the current and then dividing by subtraction of max-min. It ranges rom [0,1].
