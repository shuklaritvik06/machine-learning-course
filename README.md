## How we choose the dummy variables?

Alwayse no matter how many of the categorical columns we have we have to omit one of the categorical dummy variables from the total we have, suppose we have 10 then only 9 we have to consider. SO suppose we are having a column of Gender with Male and Female then we will only have the dummy variable for one in the linear equations

```
y = b0+b1x1+b2x2+b3D3

D3= Dummy Variable
```

## Null Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis represents a default assumption. Researchers and data scientists typically use the null hypothesis as a starting point for statistical analysis. Suppose we are tossing a coin, and we have two case that the Coin can be fair or not, So the null hypothesis would be to take the coin as fair in the starting of analysis

 ## P-Value

It represents the probability of obtaining the observed results if the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically less than a chosen significance level, often 0.05) indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

```
Alpha Values = 0.05 (P value)
```
